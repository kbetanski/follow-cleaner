# Follow Cleaner

Clean your Mastodon account follows and followers from inactive users. Inactive
users are users who have not posted anything in the last 6 months. **If user
hasn't posted anything yet, they are considered inactive too.**

## Requirements

- node >= 18.0.0

## Usage

> **Program dumps follows and followers that it would remove to JSON files with
> each execution.**
- `follows.json`
- `followers.json`

To execute the program you have to pass active access token generated by your
account. Required scope for the access token: 
- read:accounts
- read:follows
- write:blocks
- write:follows

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kbetanski/follow-cleaner.git

cd follow-cleaner

npm install

# Dry run for safety
node index.js --url=$INSTANCE_URL --access-token=$ACCESS_TOKEN --dry-run
```

## Built With

- [masto.js](https://github.com/neet/masto.js/)
- [yargs](https://github.com/yargs/yargs)


## Known issues

`Error [MastoRateLimitError]: Throttled` - Mastodon API rate limit reached. I'm
too lazy at the moment to implement handling rate limiting. Just start the
program again after a minute.
